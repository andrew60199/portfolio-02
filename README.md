# Portfolio built with React

## Description

To put my recent React skills to the test I converted my portfolio into a React single page application. Building upon the initial code and adding additional functionality such as a contact form (currently not hooked to a backend) and a link to download my resume.

The app is build on version 17. So some aspects will have changed when viewing this in the future.
